  <h2>Welcome to Your Admin Dashboard</h2>
  <p><strong>Greetings, Administrator!</strong></p>
  <p>
    Welcome to your dedicated management console. From here, you have the full
    capability to control and manage the digital contents of the card catalog,
    ensuring that your database is always up to date and serving your users with
    the latest information available.
  </p>

  <h3>How to Use This Panel</h3>
  <p>
    This admin panel is designed to facilitate easy management of the cards
    displayed on your platform. Each card represents a unique entry that can be
    managed through the following CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete)
    operations:
  </p>

  <ol>
    <li>
      <strong>Create</strong>: Add new cards by filling out the designated form
      with the card's title, description, image, and other relevant details.
      Simply navigate to the "Create" section and enter the details into the
      form fields. Submit the form to save the new card to the database.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Read</strong>: View all current entries under the "Cards List"
      section. Here, you can review all details associated with each card,
      including titles, descriptions, and images, to ensure all information is
      accurate and up to date.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Update</strong>: Modify existing cards to correct details or
      update information. Find the card you wish to update in the "Cards List"
      and click on the "Edit" button. You'll be able to change any of the
      information displayed and save the updates with just a few clicks.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Delete</strong>: Remove outdated or unnecessary cards from the
      catalog. Next to each card entry in the "Cards List" is a "Delete" button.
      Use this to remove an entry permanently from the database. Please use this
      feature with caution, as this action cannot be undone.
    </li>
  </ol>

  <h3>Best Practices</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Regular Updates</strong>: Regularly review and update card entries
      to keep the database fresh and relevant.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Consistent Formatting</strong>: When adding or editing cards,
      maintain a consistent format for dates, titles, and descriptions to ensure
      a seamless user experience.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Backup Frequently</strong>: Ensure you back up the database
      regularly to prevent data loss.
    </li>
  </ul>
